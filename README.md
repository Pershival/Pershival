### Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m M.a.Pishdar! I am a developer of fast learning methods who loves:

    - Construction of production line
    - Building teaching and learning development tools
    - Simplifying things such as training
    - Accelerate the teaching and learning process
    - Digital Learning Assets

The learning process has always been fascinating to me. My mission is to reduce the learning time for humans.
