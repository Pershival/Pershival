### Hi there 👋

Hi, I’m M.a.Pishdar! I am a developer of fast learning methods who loves:

    <ol>
    <li>Construction of production line</li>
    <li>Building teaching and learning development tools</li>
    <li>Simplifying things such as training</li>
    <li>Accelerate the teaching and learning process</li>
    <li>Digital Learning Assets</li>

The learning process has always been fascinating to me. My mission is to reduce the learning time for humans.
