Hi guys, I’m Pishdar! a creator who hates his own creation.
I'm a developer and a reverse engineer, and I also develop fast learning methods who loves:

<ul>
<li>Construction of production line</li>
<li>Building teaching and learning development tools</li>
<li>Researcher of different things</li>
<li>Simplifying things such as training</li>
<li>Designing various objects</li>
<li>Accelerate the teaching and learning process</li>
</ul>


Digital Learning Assets also excite me.


The learning process has always been fascinating to me. One of my missions is to reduce learning time for humans. Apart from the technology I deal with on a daily basis, I am also passionate in ***economics***, ***neuroscience***, ***genetics***, and ***data science*** and ***machine learning***.
