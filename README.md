### World zero and one, hellllo 👋

Hi, I’m Pishdar! I am a developer of fast learning methods who loves:

<ul>
<li>Construction of production line</li>
<li>Building teaching and learning development tools</li>
<li>Simplifying things such as training</li>
<li>Accelerate the teaching and learning process</li>
<li>Digital Learning Assets</li>
</ul>


The learning process has always been fascinating to me. My mission is to reduce the learning time for humans. Apart from the technology I deal with on a daily basis, I am also passionate in ***economics***, ***neuroscience***, ***genetics***, and ***data science*** and ***machine learning***.
